The tests in this directory do not run in CI.

They can be used to do deep validations on the behavior of the library against the actual Particle API

Follow the directions at in each script for how to use them.

Also, you'll need set valid values for env vars like PARTICLE_API_BASE_URL
and PARTICLE_API_TOKEN.

Note also that these e2e-tests are not actively maintained.
